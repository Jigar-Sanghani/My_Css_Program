      The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language
      for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the
      content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by
      technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
      languages such as JavaScript.

      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a
      document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
      XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript

      Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
      implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers
      write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java
      without the need to recompile
